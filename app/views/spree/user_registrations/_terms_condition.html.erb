<h5>Payment</h5>
<p>The Services purchased by the Customer will be in the form of a specific Windows, Linux, VPS or Reseller Service Plan. Each Service Plan outlines the features, resources, and storage that we will provide to the Customer for the stated Service Fee. Each Service Plan along with their features, resources, storage and Service Fee are defined at www.we.com. we has the sole right to determine how the features, storage and resources under each Service Plan are interpreted and how they will be provided to the Customer. The Customer must clarify any questions about the Service Plan he or she wishes to purchase with we before registration. The Service Plan will be provided to the Customer in the form of a Service Account, which would allow the Customer to manage and use the features, resources and storage stated in the chosen Service Plan. All prices mentioned in the TOS and at www.we.com are in US Dollars (USD)</p>
<p>While registering for a Service Plan, the customer may choose a Billing Period (also know as Payment Term) of 1 Month, 3 Months, 6 Months or 1 Year. All Service Accounts are setup on a pre-pay basis. Upon the start of each Billing Period, the Customer will be charged the Service fee for the duration of the Billing Period. There may be additional charges according to our Overage Policy if any additional resources, features or storage is purchased or used by the Customer under the chosen Service Plan (which were not otherwise included for free). The Billing Period will renew itself automatically on termination unless the Customers chooses to cancel his or her Service Account (according to the Cancellation/Refund Policy)</p>
<p>All charges will be debited against the Customer's balance maintained by we. If the Customer's debt exceeds $4.00 USD, he or she is required to clear his or her balance within 7 days by the chosen Payment Mode (selected during registration). If the customer's chosen payment method is Credit Card, we would attempt to charge the credit card number provided by customer (upon or after registration) automatically. For all other purchases (i.e. purchases made from - 2Checkout.com & PayPal.com as well as by Cheque), customer must manually pay following payment procedures defined by we. Failure of customer to pay manually or for we to charge customer's credit card (due to any reason, in particular in case of an invalid credit card number or credentials) would lead to Service Account suspension.

If Customer uses/purchases more than 200% of the resources allocated in the chosen Hosting Plan, we reserves the right to terminate the Customer's Service Account with a 5-day prior notification.
